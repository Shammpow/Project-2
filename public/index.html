                    Are you fed up with snacks and drinks that don't pointelessly reference nerdy games, movies, books, and TV shows?

                    <br />
                    <br /> Do you routinely get thrown out of bars after angrily demanding to be served a drink that "tastes like
                    the Hypnotoad from
                    <strong>Futurama</strong>"?

                    <br />
                    <br /> Would you sooner punch yourself in the face than eat one more marshmallow-esque dessert that isn't shaped
                    like Kirby or Mallow?

                    <br />
                    <br /> Did you come
                    <i>this</i> close to divorcing your spouse the last time he/she poured you a martini that didn't reference
                    a Terry Prachett novel?

                    <br />
                    <br /> Did a woman recently break up with you - even though you weren't dating her - because you wouldn't shut
                    up about how good the food in
                    <strong>Final Fantasy XV</strong> looks?

                    Recipes posted on this site can come from anyone and anywhere. Some may be intended to be taken seriously, others...not so
                    much.

                    <br />
                    <br /> Use good judgement when browsing our site and, as always, never consume anything harmful to your health:

                </div>

                <br />

                <ul>

                    <li> Nothing toxic</li>
                    <li> Nothing you're allergic to</li>
                    <li> No overindulging in alcohol</li>
                    <li> No underage drinking</li>
                    <li> No drunk driving</li>
                    <li> No drunk spellcasting</li>
                    <li> No consumption of magical substances without a high-level wizard present</li>

                </ul>

                <br />

                <div class="center">

                    Oh, and no wasting years of your life searching for fictional and/or supernatural ingredients...that's not a health warning
                    per se, just good advice.

                    <br />
                    <br /> Stay safe. Stay healthy. Stay nerdy. Have fun.
